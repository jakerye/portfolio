## Next steps
- Iterate on proof-of-concept
- Double action hinges required a good bit of force to close properly
- Concerned what would happen if it closed on a dogs leg accidentally
- Either need to figure out how to make purely mechanical solution safer
  - Considered soft flaps with more conventional dog door style opening
  - Concerned it would compromise the aesthetic and defeat the purpose 
- Or introduce electronics
  - Makes the entire solution more complex / expensive
